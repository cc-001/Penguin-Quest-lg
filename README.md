_Status: still in development_

Ongoing development of a platformer using C# and Unity with a focus on skeletal animation featuring a jumping and sliding penguin in a spline-based world complete with slope alignment, camera following, HUD, and root motion.

*Currently, mechanics are pretty much done, but level design, scoring, collectibles, and spawning, are not yet fleshed out.*
